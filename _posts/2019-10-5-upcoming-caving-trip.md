We have a caving trip coming up in a few weeks! Boys will go spelunking in an underground cave. We want to see as many boys as possible coming on this trip.

We did this trip last year, and the boys had a blast. Here is a few pictures from last year:

If you would like to sign up, you can do it right [here on TroopTrack.](https://google.com)

We hope to see you on the trip!
